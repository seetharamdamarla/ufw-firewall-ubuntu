## Task Objectives
- Configure a basic firewall on Linux using UFW
- Block inbound traffic on port **23 (Telnet)**
- Allow secure access via port **22 (SSH)**
- Test the firewall using Telnet
- Clean up rules and restore original settings

## What I Learned

- How to manage firewall rules using UFW
- The importance of blocking insecure services (like Telnet)
- Real-world testing using Telnet
- Resetting and cleaning up firewall configurations
- Prepared for common firewall-related interview questions.

## Tools Used

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
