🔥 Task 4: Firewall Configuration Using UFW on Ubuntu 22.04 🐧

📜 Commands Used:

1️⃣ Enable UFW Firewall
   🔧 sudo ufw enable

2️⃣ Check Current UFW Status and Rules
   🔍 sudo ufw status numbered

3️⃣ Block Incoming Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet) 🚫
   🛡️ sudo ufw deny 23

4️⃣ Check Rules After Adding the Block
   📋 sudo ufw status numbered

5️⃣ Install Telnet (for Testing) 🧪
   📦 sudo apt install telnet

6️⃣ Test Connection to Port 23
   🧪 telnet localhost 23
   ⚠️ (You should see a connection error — this confirms that port 23 is blocked.)

7️⃣ Allow SSH Port (Optional but Recommended) ✅
   🔓 sudo ufw allow 22

8️⃣ Delete the Deny Rule on Port 23 (Clean-up) 🧹
   ❌ sudo ufw delete deny 23
   💡 (Or using rule number, e.g., rule 1: sudo ufw delete 1)

9️⃣ Final Check of UFW Rules
   🔍 sudo ufw status numbered

📝 Notes:
- 🧱 UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a simplified frontend for managing iptables.
- ❗ Port 23 (Telnet) is blocked as it's insecure and should not be exposed to the internet.
- ✅ Port 22 (SSH) is allowed to ensure remote access remains functional.
