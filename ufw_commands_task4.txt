Firewall Configuration Using UFW on Ubuntu 22.04

Commands Used:

1) Enable UFW Firewall
    > sudo ufw enable

2) Check Current UFW Status and Rules
    > sudo ufw status numbered

3) Block Incoming Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
    > sudo ufw deny 23

4) Check Rules After Adding the Block
    > sudo ufw status numbered

5) Install Telnet (for Testing) 
    > sudo apt install telnet

6) Test Connection to Port 23
    > telnet localhost 23
    (You should see a connection error â€” this confirms that port 23 is blocked.)

7) Allow SSH Port (Optional but Recommended)
    > sudo ufw allow 22

8) Delete the Deny Rule on Port 23 (Clean-up) 
    > sudo ufw delete deny 23
    (Or using rule number, e.g., rule 1: sudo ufw delete 1)

9)  Final Check of UFW Rules
    > sudo ufw status numbered

Notes:
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a simplified frontend for managing iptables.
- Port 23 (Telnet) is blocked as it's insecure and should not be exposed to the internet.
- Port 22 (SSH) is allowed to ensure remote access remains functional.
